# UX Review #

## General ##
This Review is conducted in accordance with the guidelines presented in the ``FHBurgenland HID 02-UX-Prototyping & UX Review`` document from 13.12.
Points in ``green`` color are already considered and implemented.

## Specific Feedback Points ##
1. <span style="color:green;">**Anmeldungsformular Accessibility**</span>: Moving the "Anmeldung" (registration) form to its own page could streamline the user experience by reducing clutter
    on the main page and align with common design practices.

2. **Consistent Language**: Ensure consistent use of language throughout the application. The mix of German and English (e.g., "Dashboard") can be confusing.

3. <span style="color:green;">**Available places in Kindergarden** </span>: Improve visibility of how many places in a kindergarden are left for enrollment. 

4. <span style="color:green;">**Readability and accessibility**</span>: Increase font size and consider font type adjustments for better readability across devices.

5. <span style="color:green;">**Color Contrast and Accessibility**</span>: Review and adjust color schemes for sufficient contrast to support users with visual impairments.

6. **Responsive Design**: Ensure that the application's design is adaptable to different screen sizes for optimal accessibility and usability.

7. **Feedback on Interaction**: Implement clear success and error messaging systems to provide feedback during user interactions.

8.  <span style="color:green;">**Formular öffnen/schließen Button**</span>:With the "Anmeldung" form moving to its own dedicated page, the "Formular öffnen/schließen"
   button becomes redundant on the main page. Removing this button will streamline the user interface. Instead, a direct link to the "Anmeldung" form should be included in the main navigation, providing a cleaner and more direct pathway for users to register.
    
9. <span style="color:green;">**Add descriptive texts**:</span> Add more texts to the user interface to streamline the meaning of the presented content.

10. <span style="color:green;">**Add Widgets to the Dashboard**:</span> Add widgets to the dashboard so that the user can see how many ``seats`` per kindergarden 
    are left for enrollment.

11. <span style="color:green;">**Add Carousel for pictures in the kindergardens page**:</span> Add a carousel so that pictures auto rotate without the user needing to
    click to the next image.

## Technical Functionalities to Integrate (Not UX Feedback Points) ##
- Filters and sorting functionalities, including filtering by kindergarten and sorting by various parameters.
- A new page with detailed views for each kindergarten, including information and images.
- A loading spinner for initial data load and when deleting a kindergarten registration.
