# UX Review #

## General ##
This Review is conducted in accordance with the guidelines presented in the ``FHBurgenland HID 02-UX-Prototyping & UX Review`` document from 13.12.

## Specific Feedback Points ##
1. **Anmeldungsformular Accessibility**: Moving the "Anmeldung" (registration) form to its own page could streamline the user experience by reducing clutter
    on the main page and align with common design practices.

2. **Consistent Language**: Ensure consistent use of language throughout the application. The mix of German and English (e.g., "Dashboard") can be confusing.

3. **Visual Hierarchy and Layout**: Improve alignment and spacing around input fields and labels to enhance visual appeal and functionality.

4. **Typography and Readability**: Increase font size and consider font type adjustments for better readability across devices.

5. **Color Contrast and Accessibility**: Review and adjust color schemes for sufficient contrast to support users with visual impairments.

6. **Responsive Design**: Ensure that the application's design is adaptable to different screen sizes for optimal accessibility and usability.

7. **Feedback on Interaction**: Implement clear success and error messaging systems to provide feedback during user interactions.

8. **Formular öffnen/schließen Button**: With the "Anmeldung" form moving to its own dedicated page, the "Formular öffnen/schließen"
   button becomes redundant on the main page. Removing this button will streamline the user interface. Instead, a direct link to the "Anmeldung" form should be included in the main navigation, providing a cleaner and more direct pathway for users to register.


## Technical Functionalities to Integrate (Not UX Feedback Points) ##
- Filters and sorting functionalities, including filtering by kindergarten and sorting by various parameters.
- A new page with detailed views for each kindergarten, including information and images.
- A loading spinner for initial data load and when deleting a kindergarten registration.

## UX Improvements for Dashboard Page ##
1. **Informational Dashboard Widgets**: Incorporate widgets summarizing key information such as total enrollment and available places per kindergarden.
2. **Search Functionality**: Implement a search bar for quick data retrieval.
3. **Notification Center**: Create a section for alerts and notifications.
4. **Quick Action Buttons**: Provide shortcuts for frequent tasks through easily accessible buttons.
5. **User Profile Access**: Offer a small profile summary with quick links on the dashboard for user account management.

## Feature Enhancements for Dashboard Page ##
1. **Real-time Data Updates**: The dashboard should display real-time updates.
2. **Multi-language Support**: Provide a feature for users to switch between different language interfaces.
3. **Integration with Communication Platforms**: Facilitate communication through the dashboard with messaging or email features.
4. **Resource Section**: Provide educational and informational resources for parents and staff.
5. **Calendar Integration**: Embed a calendar for important dates and events.
6. **Feedback Loop**: Implement a feature for direct user feedback submission on the dashboard.

## Additional Recommendations ##
- **Navigation Clarity**: Include clear navigation options for users to access various parts of the application easily.

- **Input Field Clarity**: Use placeholder text or tooltips to inform users about the expected input in each field.

- **User Feedback System**: A robust feedback system for actions like form submissions will make the application more intuitive.
